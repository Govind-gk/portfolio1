                            A mini project that mainly functions to amplify the weak input signal given to the circuit. Meam included 3 more members
                            and worked together for completimg the project successfully.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The main analog IC used in this project was IC 741 and the function of this circuit was to amplify very very weak input signal 
                            that can be in any form and produces the output. 
                            It finds variouys applications like in spying purpose. Here in this project too our team had 4 members including myself, and 
                            we completed the project.
