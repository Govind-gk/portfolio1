        According to The Merriam-Webster Dictionary,nature is “a creative and controlling force in the universe,” “the external world in its entirety” or “humankind’s original condition.”    
        The New Oxford American Dictionary describes nature as “the phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of 
        the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations”; “the basic or inherent features of something, especially when seen as characteristic of it”; or “the innate or 
        essential qualities or character of a person or animal.”
